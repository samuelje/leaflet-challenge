### Data and Code Information
* The `static` folder contains a custom CSS, map image, and a `config.js` file. The `config.js` file holds the MapBox API key, which needs to be entered in order to run and view the map visualization.
* A `Leaflet-Step-1` folder contains the `logic.js` file for the basic visualization.
* The root folder contains the basic visualization `index.html`.

### Level 1: Basic Visualization

The following steps were followed after loading the data using d3:

* Create a map using Leaflet that plots all earthquakes from the geoJSON data set based on latitude and longitude locations.

* The circle data markers indicate the magnitude of the earthquake by varrying size and color (legend provided to easily interpret).

* Popups included that provide information when clicked about that specific earthquake.
